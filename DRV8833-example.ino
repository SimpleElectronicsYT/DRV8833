// allow us to control motor speed)

// Setting the 4 "signal" pins for the DRV8833 - sig1 and sig2 control one motor,
// sig3 and sig4 control another.

 *  half speed. Between the steps it will stop all the motors for a second.
 *  If your motor spins the opposite direction from what you expected, just reverse the
 *  polarity of your motor.
